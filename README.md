# Android_Studio_BitcoinAPI

API JSON contains Fruits with multiple arttributes, when API was updated, information etc... 
The APP has Buttons and Menu items where you choose currency and give you the information and value you want and updates every 10 seconds. If the request doesnt work it will check and let you know in text.
Thanks to google documentation, stackoverflow community, school and guides on blogs and streaming sites helping me reach my goal making this project and learning!
